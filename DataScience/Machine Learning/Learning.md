## Python libraries

### Numpy

 NumPy is a well-known Python library for multi-dimensional array and matrix processing. NumPy is ideally suited for machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) projects since it can handle linear algebra, the Fourier transform, and more. Users may quickly change the matrix to enhance machine learning performance. In comparison to most other Python libraries, NumPy is quicker and simpler to use.

### Pandas

 Another Python package, Pandas, which is based on NumPy, is in charge of creating high-quality data sets for machine learning and training. It utilises one-dimensional (series) and two-dimensional data structures (DataFrame). Because of this, Pandas can be used in many different fields, including as finance, engineering, and statistics. The Pandas library moves quickly, complies with rules, and is adaptable, unlike the sluggish animals themselves.

### Matplotlib

A Python data visualisation toolkit called Matplotlib is mostly used to produce stunning graphs, plots, histograms, and bar charts. It is compatible with charting data generated by Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. If you've used other kinds of graphing software in the past, Matplotlib might be the most natural choice for you.

### Seaborn 

Another open-source Python library, Seaborn, employs Pandas' data structures and is built on Matplotlib (which focuses on plotting and data visualisation). As a result of its ability to provide plots of learning data, Seaborn is frequently employed in ML projects. It produces the most aesthetically beautiful graphs and plots out of all the Python libraries, making it a good choice if you'll also use it for data analysis and marketing.

### TensorFLow

The free and open-source TensorFlow Python library specialises in a type of programming known as differentiable programming, which allows for the automatic computation of a function's derivatives in high-level languages. TensorFlow's adaptable architecture and framework enable the quick development and evaluation of both machine learning and deep learning models. On desktop and mobile devices, machine learning models can be visualised using TensorFlow.

### Keras

The Python library Keras was created primarily for creating neural networks for machine learning models. It may be used to train neural networks on top of Theano and TensorFlow. Keras is adaptable, portable, user-friendly, and simple to combine with a variety of tasks.
